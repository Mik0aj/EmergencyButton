# EmergencyButton
![Alt Text](documentation/pictures/emergencybutton.png)

Making this project as a joke, and to practise some design patterns on embedded systems. The end goal is the device that will display a random messeage saying that some device in the factory has been switched off, as well as giving a made up reason why it stoped working.
